# MAD Practical 5 - RecyclerView
This week, you will be creating a simple To-Do list using RecyclerView. 

Each row in the RecyclerView contains a TextView (displaying the task) and a CheckBox
At the bottom of the screen, there is a textbox and a button to add the new task to the to-do-list. 
The TextBox and the RecyclerView needs to auto resize according to the screen sizes.
